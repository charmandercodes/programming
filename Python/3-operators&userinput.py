# ARITHMETIC OPERATORS 

# You have addition, subtraction, multiplication , division

print(2 + 2)
print(2 - 2)
print(2 * 2)
print(2 / 2)

# Modulus gives you remainder of a number

print(12 % 3)
print(11 % 3)

# Floor division rounds down the number 

print( 10 // 3)
print( -10 // 3)

# Exponent which is power 

print(2**4)

# ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 

x = 5

print(x + 10)  # Output: 15

x += 10
print(x)  # Output: 15

x += 10
print(x)  # Output: 25

x -= 10
print(x)  # Output: 15

x *= 10
print(x)  # Output: 150

x /= 10
print(x)  # Output: 15.0

# COMPARISON OPERATORS

x = 10 
y = 20 

# Works with strings as welll

# x = "Hello"
# y = 'Hi'
# y = "Hello"

print(x == y)
print(x < y)
print(x > y)
print(x >= y)
print(x <= y)
print(x != y)


# LOGICAL OPERATORS 

# And: Both sides have to true to be true

print(10 < 20 and 5 > 20)
  
# Or: One side has to be true to be true 

print(10 < 20 or 5 > 20)

# Not: Negates whatever truth value is 

print(not (10 < 20 and 5 > 20))

# USER INPUT 

# Stores input of user as string, needs typecasting

x = input("Enter number one: ")
y = input("Enter number two: ")

x = int(x)
y = int(y)

print(x + y)
